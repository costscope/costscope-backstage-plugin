# Code of Conduct

This project adopts the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) (v2.1) to foster an open, welcoming, and productive community.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and empathetic
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the broader community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Trolling, insulting comments, personal attacks
- Publishing others’ private information without permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Scope

This Code applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Enforcement

Report abuse or violations confidentially to: **dev404ai@gmail.com** (use this address for both Code of Conduct and security disclosures – see `SECURITY.md`). Include relevant context, links, and timestamps. A maintainer will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours (usually faster) and begin a confidential review.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these community impact guidelines:

1. Correction
2. Warning
3. Temporary Ban / Suspension
4. Permanent Ban

The guiding principles are proportionality, transparency (when privacy allows), and restoration where possible.
