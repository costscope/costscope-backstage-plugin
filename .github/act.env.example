## Example environment file for `act` (costscope-backstage-plugin)
# Copy to .github/act.env and adjust. Unset lines are safe.
# Note: values from this file have the lowest precedence; if a workflow/job
# sets the same env var, that value will override what you set here.

# Node.js version used by some workflows (e.g., Storybook). Our Storybook
# workflow currently pins this in YAML, so this acts only as a default
# for jobs that don't set it explicitly.
NODE_VERSION=20

# E2E browsers matrix used by E2E workflows.
# Workflows typically set this via matrix; this serves as a local default
# for ad‑hoc runs that don't define it.
