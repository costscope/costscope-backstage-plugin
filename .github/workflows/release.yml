name: DEPRECATED release workflow

# This file intentionally does nothing. It previously contained two separate workflows
# mixed into one YAML which is invalid. The release flows are now split into:
#   - .github/workflows/release-version.yml (version PR via Changesets)
#   - .github/workflows/release-publish.yml (tag-based npm publish with provenance)
# Keeping this stub to avoid accidental triggers until fully removed in a follow-up.
